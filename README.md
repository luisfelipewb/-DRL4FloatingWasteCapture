# DRL4FloatingWasteCapture

Advancing ASV Autonomy for Environmental Cleanup: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Floating Waste Capture

## Description

We extend an IsaacSim-based RL framework to simulate hydrodynamics and buoyancy to train RL agents to capture floating trash.


## Installation

### 1. RL Framework
To install the RL framework for simulating hydrodynamics and buoyancy, follow the instructions in the [RANS-ASV-IROS2024](https://github.com/JunghwanRo/RANS-ASV-IROS2024) repository. Ensure that all requirements mentioned in that repository are met.

### 2. Kingfisher-related Code
Additionally, you'll need the Kingfisher-related code for running simulations and real-world tests. This code can be found in the [kingfisher_control](https://github.com/luisfelipewb/kingfisher_control) repository.

Follow the instructions provided in the repository to set up the Kingfisher-related code.

## Usage

For running training and test procedures, please refer to the respective repositories:

- **RL Framework**: Follow the instructions provided in the [RANS-ASV-IROS2024](https://github.com/JunghwanRo/RANS-ASV-IROS2024) repository.
- **Kingfisher-related Code**: Instructions for running simulations and real-world tests can be found in the [kingfisher_control](https://github.com/luisfelipewb/kingfisher_control) repository.
